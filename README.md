Submit your Unit 7 Assignment Here. Pick a moral problem or a case in business that we have not already analyzed in any detail in class. A moral problem is one in which there is some difference of opinion. The issue is not clear cut and there is no consensus on it. Similarly, a case should be one about which there is some debate. Write a paper arguingto a conclusion about the morality of the problem or the case you have chosen. The problem may consist either of a general issue of policy or a specific issue that is found in a case you analyze. Any case that raises an ethical issue in business is appropriate.

In your paper: (1) Start by explaining the moral problem or outlining the case. (2) Then present the moral arguments which support your conclusion. You may use whatever approach to moral argumentation (from among those we have studied) that you choose. Make clear the moral criterion you are using to decide the issue. Develop your arguments clearly, step by step, giving reasons for the position you defend. (3) Present and answer at least one argument that someone on the other side of the question might put forth.

You may use this assignment to pursue some moral issue in business we have not discussed in class. The issue might be one raised in some other class or one you find in the newspapers or periodicals, or one about which you are concerned. The problem might deal with some aspect of a business practice within a profession in which you are interested; it might concern individual or corporate responsibility; it can deal with an aspect of advertising, discrimination and affirmative action, conflict of interest, trade secrets, multinationals, and so on, as long as we have not discussed it in detail in the class. You may use any sources you wish for background information. The paper, however, is not to be a report of what other people say; you are to argue the issue to a conclusion.

If you have any question about whether the topic you want to write your paper on is an acceptable topic in business ethics, please check the topic with me before you write the paper.

(If it is helpful, you might think of the paper as an article you are writing to convince the general public about the morality of a case or practice; you might also think of it as a letter to the President to convince him of the morality or immorality of some practice or policy. A good paper will be well argued, and so convincing.)
